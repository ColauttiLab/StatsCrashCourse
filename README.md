# StatsCrashCourse

Tutorials for a crash course in applied statistics and machine learning in R for biologists. Inspired by chapters from the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibsharini.

Tutorials are written in R Markdown with R Studio.

# Add Chapters with R Studio

1. Create a Github account if you don't already have one
2. Set up Git and GitHub with R Studio, as outlined in [this link](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)
3. Make a new project (File-> New Project) and select version control with Git
4. Set a local directory and link to the GitHub site: https://github.com/ColauttiLab/StatsCrashCourse
5. Email robert.colautti -->at<-- Queensu.ca with your github user name for writing privileges.
